===========================
 EDSAC Simulator in Python
===========================

I think EDSAC is good to learn machine language,
because recent CPU is complex.

My goal is to make a Python version to run on console,
and a JavaScript version to run on browser.


Design
======

We now have plenty of memory than 1950s.
For easy learning and inspectation,
use memories in human-readable way.
